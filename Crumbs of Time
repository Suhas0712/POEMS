Crumbs of Time

Could have been a creators
A model a butterfly a star
But the universe as cruel as it is
Cutting the nips of a bud
Of a flower which could have bloomed 
Like no other overshadowing the forest 
While others ponder of its beauty
But the universe demanding its balance 
Maybe Placed under the wrong house 
Maybe the wrong family
But still acomely star burning up its life 
Of which my love can only gaze at 
and not pour life as im all but helpless
Maybe it wasn't the universe 
but my yearn for love
As I thought I was unfit for it 
But yearned much for
Which burns you
It wasn't written in the heaven 
yet was ephemeral 
My love can only pray for you
For your wellness your happiness 
Maybe not this life or this universe 
But our bond shall have been engraved forever in the heavens
