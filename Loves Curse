Loves Curse 

You and I are are peace and chaos
Co exist but can never be together 
Maybe that's why we were tormented 
While trying to get close
Your the epitome of beauty and heaven
While I represent repulsive and the pits of hell 
Meant to co exist but never together 
Our creators were indeed harsh to put such a clause
Or we wouldn't suffer such comeuppance 
I love you but I rather not burn you no more
Maybe to let go is the greatest love
Its also the greatest loss
But my hearth shall always remember your embers.
