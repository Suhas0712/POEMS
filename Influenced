Influenced

Waiting for you makes makes me insane
But id go to rehabilitation for you
As you make me high 
Like oxycodone
Though I have lean with my angels and demons on my shoulders looking over me,
my eyes and mind shall still be reserved for your glimmer
Though we may not converse much
It tastes of malt,
The taste of Slowburn ecstasy.
