 A KNEE TO BENT BY LOVE

I know we come from different worlds
Which are far apart like heaven and earth
But they're bound to each and another for eternity 
I yearn to bound to you in such a way
Though our worlds are apart.
As a kid milky bits were my favorite biscuit
As I looked at the biscuits all they reminded me was of you .
Though your eyes mirror the deep black abyss they emit warmth which 
I yearn to  embrace till death do us part
If you would allow me to bend the knee.
